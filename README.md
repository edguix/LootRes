# LootRes
System for reserving Loot for World of Warcraft


I believe this is based on the work of a now removed addon by CosminPOP

I will/have made changes to the original work for use with Turtle WoW.

Under recent changes to Turtle WoW's chat system, if there are too many raid messages sent, the Loot Master will get muted. I will makes changes to how slow the messages will get sent out as to still have lots of time for raiders to roll for their loot and minimize the amount of messages transmitted by loot master.
